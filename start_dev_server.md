## Python

Install Python 3 - follow [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/57caae30bd7b0991098e9804a9494c23).

Start in the current directory.

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
   
Start in a subdirectory. The brackets means run in a subshell so you remain where you are when the command is stopped.
